            Universal mobile gamepad
        </h3>
        <p>
            This project allows to use mobile device as controller for console or pc games. On this research stage, gamepad works with Retro Pie but
            in near future in plan is extension for other consoles like Play Station, Xbox, etc. Mobile Gamepad is designed for possibilities on mobile
            device but layout is prepared for most games. This is research project and from user experience will be well-fitted for gamers.

            How it works ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            User has to install software (<a href=" https://github.com/sbidolach/mobile-gamepad">which is available on github</a>) on device where is installed Retro Pie. Mobile device has to be connected
            to this same wireless network. When we have devices in this same network then on mobile device user has to go to web site described in
            github instruction. Web site with layout for gamepad can be added as a shortcut to mobile desktop. The icon in mobile device allows run
            gamepad in each time, when we want use this software as controller for games.
